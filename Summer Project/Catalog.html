                        <h2> FAWAZ JALEEL - NOBODY LIKES AN OUTSIDER </h2>
                        <p>- “We'll choose the Constitution over the Quran, Bible and Gita. Into that heaven, let my country awake" Ashraf Zain.<br>
                            - An outsider and popular leader who breaks into Bihar politics after parting ways with the Bharatiya National Congress (BNC), is killed in a road accident in Begusarai.<br>
                            - BNC blames the ruling party, SDP, over the death of Ashraf, an inspirational & visionary “minority” leader.
                             Enter Yohan Tytler, a recently promoted CBI lead investigator, along with his associates - the analytical Sukumar Azhagu, and the “I always play by the books” investigator Ila Qureshi.<br>
                            - Before the investigation even begins, and while the state is still trying to grasp what just happened, Ashraf’s PA, Piyali Sharma, is found dead in a hotel room at Begusarai – under mysterious circumstances.
                              Before he knows it, Yohan is thrown into a quagmire of political power play, intellectual mafias, media pressure, religious leaders, increasing suspects, and other powerful people. Under the radar of the media, the young CBI team manoeuvres through the case facts,
                               only to find that the deaths are linked to major events in the modern history of not just Begusarai but of the whole of Bihar.<br>
                            - As the events unfold,
                            the entire nation is shocked to see the underlying motive behind the actual motive that reveals a lesser-spoken reality in India.</p>
